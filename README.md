# Item_Recommendation
Application of Apriori Algorithm

* Get Started with [Apriori Recommendation Algorithm](https://github.com/LukasPurbaW/Item_Recommendation/blob/main/Apriori_Recommendation_Algorithm.ipynb)
* [Image Scrapper.ipynb](https://github.com/LukasPurbaW/Item_Recommendation/raw/main/Image_Scrapper.ipynb) is used for downloading images of listed items from duckduckgo for better visualization. 
* I divided the pictures with different zip files because the upload limit is 25 MB and I still haven't used to using git-push.
